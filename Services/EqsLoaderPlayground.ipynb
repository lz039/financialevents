It also guided sales in the current quarter of $38.5B-$41B, vs. an expected $39.2B.</p> <p class=\\\"paywall-full-content invisible\\\">Shares of the company <span class=\\\"green\\\">rose as much as 11%</span> to a session high of $527.17. Stock is <span class=\\\"green\\\">up nearly 40% </span>so far this year.</p> <p class=\\\"paywall-full-content invisible\\\"><strong>Citi's takeaway</strong>: The research firm is \\\"incrementally positive\\\" on shares of Meta, given engagement &amp; monetization gains and expanding margins. It said engagement remains core to continued growth. Advertising momentum in Q2 suggests several longer-term benefits as AI and ad innovations drive conversions. Capex spend is expected to remain elevated for at least the next several years for the company. PT raised to $580 from $550.</p> <p class=\\\"paywall-full-content invisible\\\"><strong>JP Morgan's takeaway: </strong>JPM thinks Meta is showing signs of progress across three key areas of its broader AI strategy: 1) core FoA improvements; 2) new opportunities &amp; experiences; &amp; 3) scaling the Metaverse. They believe Meta’s virtual ownership of the social graph, strong competitive moat, and focus on the user experience position it to become an enduring blue-chip company built for the long term. On guidance, they said, \\\"The 3Q revenue outlook implies ~1% of FXN decelaration from 2Q at the high end despite ~900bps tougher comps as Meta laps heavy China advertiser spending, Reels monetization ramp, &amp; strong engagement tailwinds from 2023.\\\" PT hiked from $480 to $610.</p> <p class=\\\"paywall-full-content invisible\\\"><strong>Morgan Stanley's takeaway: </strong>MS was also encouraged by AI advances, which continue to improve recommendation quality and drive engagement. They saw progress on longer-term engagement initiatives including WhatsApp, Meta AI, and Threads and observed healthy trends, particularly from young adults on Facebook.<strong> </strong>Given the underlying core engagement and revenue strength the company is seeing, MS now expects ’25/’26 capex to rise by ~6%/12% ($2.5bn/ $5.6bn). PT changed from $550 to $575.</p> <p class=\\\"paywall-full-content invisible\\\"><strong>Bank of America's takeaway: \\\"</strong>We see Meta as the top AI play in consumer Internet given: 1) Leading infrastructure and LLM capabilities w/ Llama 3.1, 2) evidence of core AI driving strong ad growth, and new multi-year growth opportunities in Gen-AI, and 3) growing core app usage for younger users in US and strong Intl. usage of Meta AI possibly addressing terminal value risk... Meta could see upside in 2025 with a potential TikTok ban,\\\" BofA analysts said. PT raised to $563 from $550.</p> <p class=\\\"paywall-full-content invisible\\\"><strong>Barclays takeaway: \\\"</strong>META continues to execute at arguably the best pace of any company in digital advertising, with little revenue deceleration despite facing very tough comps in 2H24. We do worry about the capex/opex trend next year as higher-margin ad revenue growth slows (for META &amp; the industry) but trends are looking impressive,\\\" they said. PT raised from $520 to $550.</p> <p class=\\\"paywall-full-content invisible\\\"><strong>Goldman Sachs' takeaway: </strong>\\\"In terms of investments, a reiterated 2024 opex guidance and narrowing to the top half of the capex guidance (now $37-40b) would signal that META’s revenue growth trajectory is likely the biggest driver of earnings variance in 2H 2024... Looking for the remainder of the year, we do see the shares as likely being volatile to a mixture of the digital advertising end demand dynamic as well as any further signals about 2025 investment priorities/levels.\\\" PT upped to $555 from $522.</p> <div id=\\\"more-links\\\" class=\\\"paywall-full-content invisible\\\"> <h2>More on Meta Platforms </h2> <ul> <li><a

Discovery (<span class=\\\"ticker-hover-wrapper\\\">NASDAQ:<a href=\\\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WBD\\\" title=\\\"Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.\\\">WBD</a></span>) ahead of its second quarter earnings report next month with mixed feelings about the company's<span class=\\\"paywall-full-content invisible\\\"> growth potential.</span></p> <p class=\\\"paywall-full-content invisible\\\">The mass media and entertainment conglomerate has valuable assets in its arsenal, which is one of the main reasons for Street analysts not turning bearish, but its large debt load of nearly $40B is eye-popping.</p> <p class=\\\"paywall-full-content invisible\\\">Investors will also be watching out for the impact of its recent loss of NBA broadcasting rights and if it can weather it, among other things, ahead of results. Analysts at BofA, UBS, and Benchmark have discussed the company in their respective analyses throughout the week.</p> <p class=\\\"paywall-full-content invisible\\\"><em>What BofA has to say: </em>While expressing concerns about the company's declining stock price, which is <span class=\\\"red\\\">down over 70%</span>, BofA on Tuesday pointed out that the full value of the merger with Discovery has not materialized and the current composition is not working. They believe that many of its assets are \\\"best in class,\\\" and exploring a sale, restructuring, and/or merger would create \\\"more shareholder value.\\\"</p> <p class=\\\"paywall-full-content invisible\\\">\\\"In a hypothetical scenario, WBD could spin off their DTC and Studio assets as a standalone company, unburdened by the constraints of an onerous debt load, leaving the linear assets with a significant amount (if not all) of their debt on the remaining entity. This, in all likelihood, would be a negative for WBD’s debt but would, in our view, be quite accretive to equity value,\\\" BofA said in a July 16 report. They reiterated their \\\"Buy\\\" rating but trimmed PT to $12 from $14.</p> <p class=\\\"paywall-full-content invisible\\\">UBS analysts on Monday revised their box office revenue estimates for Warner Bros. Discovery (<a href=\\\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WBD\\\" title=\\\"Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.\\\">WBD</a>), anticipating a softness, but left their consensus largely unchanged. They think in an upside case for WBD, cost-cutting efforts would help slow down the decline in the Networks segment while DTC profitability inflects higher. In a negative case, the loss of long-tail networks and a reduced line-up of sports content would hurt affiliate revenues and result in weak subscriber growth in DTC, which in turn could pressure consolidated EBITDA more than expected.</p> <p class=\\\"paywall-full-content invisible\\\"><em>What UBS has to say:</em> \\\"We expect 2Q results to show a continuation of HSD EBITDA declines at Networks and a return to slight losses in DTC but solid cash generation... We now expect 2Q EBITDA of $1.97B (prior $2.14B), driving our full-year forecast to $9.5B (prior $9.7B)... A key update at earnings will be the NBA renewal, where recent press reports suggest a resolution in the next couple of weeks.\\\"</p> <p class=\\\"paywall-full-content invisible\\\">UBS added that \\\"a successful use of matching rights could bring added pressure to EBITDA, while a loss of rights adds uncertainty to the affiliate outlook.\\\" They expect revenues to be nearly $10B for Q2 and $40.8B for 2024, and maintained \\\"Neutral\\\" rating on WBD while lowering PT to $9 from $11.</p> <p class=\\\"paywall-full-content invisible\\\">The company closed its merger with Discovery in April 2022 and has struggled to grow its stock price since then, but Benchmark analysts hope for a transitional realization of value for the combined company next year.</p> <p class=\\\"paywall-full-content invisible\\\"><em>What Benchmark has to say: </em>The equity research firm claims that the current stock price ignores $5B+ annual cost savings, momentum at DC Studios under James Gunn and Peter Safran, near-term DTC profitability, and potential room for improvement at CNN under the leadership of BBC and NYT veteran Mark Thompson.</p> <p class=\\\"paywall-full-content invisible\\\">On losing NBA broadcasting rights to NBCUniversal, Benchmark said WBD should have matched the reported $2.5B annual bid, even if it possibly results in a 5% dilution in 2026 EBITDA, and calls it \\\"a necessary evil,\\\" especially due to improved monetization prospects for its streaming assets in the long run.</p> <p class=\\\"paywall-full-content invisible\\\">Unlike BofA, which suggested multiple strategic options to unlock value, Benchmark remains adamant that salvaging linear network value should be achieved through optimizing streaming and digital monetization instead of a debt-laden spin-off.</p> <p class=\\\"paywall-full-content invisible\\\">In its report, the research firm added its praise for Warner Bros. Studios, Max/HBO, and CNN as \\\"crown jewel global media assets\\\" but stressed that a recovery in stock is also dependent on easing linear network tail value erosion.</p> <p class=\\\"paywall-full-content invisible\\\">\\\"Media executives often reflexively resort to M&amp;A and financial engineering to shore up operating business issues, although we feel any deus ex machina WBD deal solution is actually unlikely,\\\" Benchmark said in its analysis dated July 17. They maintained their \\\"Buy\\\" rating on WBD and stuck to their price target of $20.</p> <p class=\\\"paywall-full-content invisible\\\">Warner Bros. Discovery (<a href=\\\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WBD\\\" title=\\\"Warner Bros.

Still, investors will likely be concerned that DTC doesn't pay off fast enough to offset linear declines.\\\"</p> <p class=\\\"paywall-full-content invisible\\\">\\\"Our worry is that synergies account for 29%/36% of ‘25/’26 OIBDA. Investors have been hurt when peers like WBD and DIS have spoken to big cost cuts that haven't translated into higher Street ests,\\\" Wells Fargo analysts added.</p> <p class=\\\"paywall-full-content invisible\\\"><strong>UBS</strong> said that strategic shifts are likely through the Paramount-Skydance merger, but that would require navigating a tough industry backdrop. The research firm has a \\\"sell\\\" rating, citing uncertainty about the deal structure, different shareholder terms, and the 45-day go-shop period.</p> <p class=\\\"paywall-full-content invisible\\\"><strong>Morgan Stanley </strong>says the Skydance transaction brings new ownership, more capital, new verticals, and a focus on tech. The merger will help address declining linear TV revenues which could be through selling TV assets, injecting $1.5 billion of new equity into the company, and extracting $2 billion in run-rate cost savings.</p> </div> <div id=\\\"more-links\\\" class=\\\"paywall-full-content invisible\\\"> <h2>More on Paramount Global</h2> <ul> <li><a href=\\\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702922-evaluating-the-final-paramount-skydance-merger\\\" class=\\\"more-link\\\">Evaluating The Final Paramount-Skydance Merger</a></li> <li><a href=\\\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702877-paramount-shari-redstone-let-them-eat-cake-moment-with-shareholders\\\" class=\\\"more-link\\\">Paramount: Shari Redstone's 'Let Them Eat Cake' Moment With Shareholders</a></li> <li><a href=\\\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702340-paramount-deal-merry-go-round\\\" class=\\\"more-link\\\">Paramount: Deal Merry-Go-Round</a></li> <li><a href=\\\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4122483-biggest-stock-movers-today-para-and-grfs\\\" class=\\\"more-link\\\">Biggest stock movers today: LCID, PARA, GRFS, and more</a></li> <li><a href=\\\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4122482-paramount-and-skydance-agree-to-merge-shaking-up-entertainment-industry\\\" class=\\\"more-link\\\">Paramount and Skydance agree to merge, shaking up entertainment industry</a></li> </ul> </div>\",\"metered\":true,\"correctionReason\":null,\"audioDuration\":163.632},\"relationships\":{\"author\":{\"data\":{\"id\":\"57442451\",\"type\":\"newsAuthorUser\"}},\"sentiments\":{\"data\":[]},\"primaryTickers\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"600794\",\"type\":\"tag\"}]},\"secondaryTickers\":{\"data\":[]},\"otherTags\":{\"data\":[{\"id\":\"600890\",\"type\":\"tag\"}]},\"ratingChangeNotice\":{}},\"links\":{\"self\":\"/news/4122955-wolfe-research-doubtful-on-paramount-skydances-optimistic-post-merger-forecast-cuts-rating\",\"canonical\":\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4122955-wolfe-research-doubtful-on-paramount-skydances-optimistic-post-merger-forecast-cuts-rating\",\"uriImage\":\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/458669341/image_458669341.jpg?io=getty-c-w750\",\"schemaImage\":[\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/458669341/image_458669341.jpg?io=getty-c-w1280\",\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/458669341/image_458669341.jpg?io=getty-c-crop-16-9\",\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/458669341/image_458669341.jpg?io=getty-c-crop-4-3\"]}},{\"id\":\"4122641\",\"type\":\"news\",\"attributes\":{\"publishOn\":\"2024-07-08T11:11:04-04:00\",\"isLockedPro\":false,\"commentCount\":1,\"gettyImageUrl\":\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/930223342/image_930223342.jpg\",\"videoPreviewUrl\":null,\"videoDuration\":null,\"themes\":{\"us\":{\"id\":326,\"path\":\"/\",\"slug\":\"us\",\"title\":null,\"sasource\":\"\",\"non_theme\":true},\"small-cap\":{\"id\":115422,\"path\":\"/\",\"slug\":\"small-cap\",\"title\":null,\"sasource\":\"\",\"non_theme\":true},\"notable-calls\":{\"id\":600890,\"path\":\"/\",\"slug\":\"notable-calls\",\"title\":null,\"sasource\":\"\",\"non_theme\":true},\"news-metered\":{\"id\":614465,\"path\":\"/\",\"slug\":\"news-metered\",\"title\":null,\"sasource\":\"\",\"non_theme\":true},\"consumer\":{\"id\":614789,\"path\":\"/market-news/consumer\",\"slug\":\"consumer\",\"title\":\"Consumer \",\"sasource\":\"theme_breadcrumb\",\"non_theme\":false}},\"title\":\"Wells Fargo cuts Bumble to equal weight on lackluster relaunch, reacceleration challenges\",\"isPaywalled\":false,\"lastModified\":\"2024-07-08T11:36:28-04:00\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"content\":\"<div> <p>Wells Fargo downgraded Bumble (<span class=\\\"ticker-hover-wrapper\\\">NASDAQ:<a href=\\\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BMBL\\\" title=\\\"Bumble Inc.\\\">BMBL</a></span>) to \\\"Equal Weight\\\" from a previous investment rating of \\\"Overweight,\\\" citing that buzz around the dating app platform's April relaunch drove a \\\"bump\\\" in trends but barely any benefits were observed from it.</p> <p>The bank<span class=\\\"paywall-full-content invisible\\\"> believes reacceleration is \\\"likely more challenging\\\" in the second half of the year and hence trimmed its Q3 and Q4 estimates for Bumble App net adds to 120k and 80k, from 150k and 100k previously.

With high unit economics and an ~$200B opportunity within the CPG category, we believe Ibotta can drive significant free cash flow for shareholders”.</p> <p class=\\\"paywall-full-content invisible\\\"><strong>UBS</strong> (Price Target $125) “Ibotta is taking the right steps to position itself for durable 20%+ revenue growth as the Walmart relationship scales and Ibotta onboards new 3P publishers. Our current 20% revenue CAGR does not assume Ibotta partners with a delivery platform despite seeing a strong product fit, and Instacart, DoorDash or Uber representing larger potential opportunity than Ibotta's second largest partner, Kroger. Regarding margins, considering the ad-like nature of the Ibotta model, the key lever for delivering our targeted 70% incremental margins will be Ibotta delivering revenue growth. Currently we model cash expenses to compound at 9% annually over the next 3 years which leaves limited room for further cost cuts, but we note that Ibotta's cash expenses were flat YoY in FY23.”</p> <p class=\\\"paywall-full-content invisible\\\"><strong>Citi</strong> (Price Target $120): “Ibotta is the leader in digital promotions with 4x the digital promotions of its nearest competitor and given a 7x ROAS across its CPG partners with its closed loop attribution model, more retailers joining its network, and the potential for greater brand penetration and expansion to newer verticals, we believe Ibotta is well positioned to expand its lead across the sector. To be clear, it remains early days in the build-out of its Ibotta Performance Network (IPN) and the mix-shift from Ibotta’s core D2C app, but with Walmart now fully live and newer retailers (Family Dollar) joining, we believe more brands are likely to join the platform given Ibotta’s growing scale and reach (200M+ consumers). At scale, we believe Ibotta can deliver 50%+ EBITDA margins and believe there is likely upside to projections as Ibotta’s network expands.”</p> <p class=\\\"paywall-full-content invisible\\\"><strong>Goldman Sachs </strong>(Price Target $103): “We are initiating coverage of Ibotta with a Neutral rating and a $103 12-month PT. Ibotta is a technology company that facilitates the delivery of digital promotions by CPG brands &amp; other advertisers to consumers through the Ibotta Performance Network. We view Ibotta as positively levered to a number of long-term secular growth themes within our sector across both digital advertising and grocery (shift in spend from offline to online channels in both industries). In the current market environment, we see debates around the overall macroeconomic impact on digital advertising, the pace/cadence of 3P redeemer additions and the impact of the Walmart partnership as being the biggest potential drivers to upside/downside volatility in the coming year.”</p> <p class=\\\"paywall-full-content invisible\\\">IBTA shares have <span class=\\\"green\\\">risen nearly 6%
